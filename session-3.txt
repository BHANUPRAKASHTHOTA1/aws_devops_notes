Session - 3
--------------------------------
Add the user
password given to the user
user info
updating the user

1. useradd <username>
2. id <username>
3. cat /etc/passwd
4. /etc/passwd --> user info
5. getent passwd ---> password entries

create a password
-----------------------------
passwd <username>

by default password authentication is disabled we need to enable it
/etc/ssh/sshd_config -->this is a important file we need to take a backup 
1. cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /tmp/sshd_config_backup
2. vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
3. :/password 
4. password authentication --> Yes
5. if you want to check the changes done properly or not by using the cmd sshd -t
6. systemctl restart sshd 
7. now the user able to connect the vm by using password.

Group
-----------------------
when ever you are created a group also created by default
1. Primary Group - DevOps
2. Secondary Group - Testers

	groupadd <groupname>

3. If we want to add Bhanu into the DevOps group by using the below command
	usermod -g <groupname> <username>
4. How to add secondary group by using the below command
	usermod -aG <groupname> <username>
		g --> primary Group
	    G --> Secondary Group
5. If we want to revoke the access to the users from group
	gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>

SSH key authentication to user
-----------------------------------------------
1. Bhanu have to create a public key and private key in his device.
2. Share public key to admin
3. Admin need to create a folder on user home directory ex: .ssh
4. change permission to the folder by using the below
	chmod 700 .ssh
5. create a file called authorized_keys
6. by using vim command need to open the authorized keys
	vim authorized_keys --->then goto insert mode ---> paste the public key which was share by 	the user
Ownership
-------------------------
change the ownership to user by using the below command
	chown <username>:<groupname> -R file/folder
	chown bhanu:bhanu -R .ssh

user is leaving organisation
---------------------------------
we need to remove the user from devops group
	gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>
	gpasswd -d bhanu devops
We will get error because his primary group is DevOps for that we need to change his primary group to his own group
	usermod -g <groupname> <username>
	usermod -g bhanu bhanu
Now we can delete the user by using the below command
	userdel <username>
	userdel bhanu
Delete the Group
---------------------------------
we need to delete the group by using the below command
	groupdel <groupname>
	groupdel devops 

* make sure no users are existed in the group, if exists first need to remove the users from the group and then delete the group.

Process Management
----------------------------------
ps --> it lists the processes running
ps -ef ---> it lists all the process running and telling the linux or you assigning a task to linux to give  the result of ps -ef
	1. Foreground process ----> sleep 10
	2. background process ----> Sleep20 &

	ps -ef|grep sleep ----- > This is like an interview question.
If you want to kill task 
kill<PID>  ---> You are requesting to end the task.
kill -9 <PID> ----> You are forcing to end the task.

top ---> it will list down all the running tasks.

Package Management
-------------------------
ubuntu ----> apt -get
centos ----> yum
aws linux 2 ---> amazon-linux-extras and yum

1. sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y  ====> For AWS linux you need to install 1st this.
2. yum install git -y
3. yum remove git -y 
4. yum list all           | yum list all | wc -l
5. yum list installed     | yum list installed | wc -l
6. yum list available     | yum list available | wc -l
7. yum search git

wc ===> word count 
l ====> list
